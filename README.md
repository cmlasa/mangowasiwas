# Mango Wasiwas à la Aracama<sup>1</sup>


### This recipe was made in loving memory of Lola Lisa (1933-2021)

#### _“...[the] dessert was based on a cutout recipe, called mango wasiwas<sup>2</sup>, that his mother kept. It was a flambé with mango, much like mango jubilee served with ice cream and barquillos...”_


## Ingredients

Servings: 1-2

### _Wasiwas_:

* ½ cup mango puree
* ½ pc mango, cubed
* ¼ cup	orange juice
* ½ cup	sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch, dissolved in 1 tbsp of water
* 1 tbsp rum, brandy or liquor of choice (80-proof/40% ABV) 

### Cream:

* 1 scoop	ice cream (vanilla or flavor of choice)

### Carb:

* 1 serving	_barquillos_ (enough to lay the _wasiwas_ on top)

_OR_

* 2 pcs		_suman_ (glutinous/sticky rice cake)
* 2 tbsp		butter


## Instructions<sup>3</sup>

If using _suman_ instead of barquillos:



1. Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. 
2. Peel off the _suman_ wrappers. 
3. Fry the _suman_ over medium heat, rolling them in the hot butter occasionally, until a crisp brown crust forms. Set aside.

_Wasiwas_ Instructions:



1. Pour mango purée into a pan, bring to a boil then simmer over low heat.
2. Add the mango cubes, stir and bring the _wasiwas_ back to a simmer. 
3. Pour orange juice and stir.
4. Add sugar and keep stirring until completely dissolved. 
5. Add dissolved cornstarch and simmer for 4-6 more minutes.
6. Plate the _barquillos_ (or _fried suman_).
7. Remove the pan from the heat, pour in the liquor and ignite with a long lighter.
8. Quickly move the pan back onto the burner and carefully shake and swirl until the flames subside, about 30-45 seconds. 
9. Spoon the _wasiwas_ over the barquillos/fried suman. Top with the ice cream and drizzle with any remaining _wasiwas_ sauce in the pan.

### Notes

1: Source: [Only mention of “mango wasiwas” on the Internet (Philippine Star, 2017)](https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/health-and-family/2017/03/07/1677186/whats-cooking-chef-fern-aracama-and-kojak-english-bulldog) - Fern Aracama: _“What I did was to fry suman to a crisp, made mango wasiwas, flambéed it, set it on top of the suman, and then I put ice cream.”_

2: The term, also spelled _oasiwas_, is used in the recipe to compare the act of flambéing the mangoes to the _wasiwas_ (swinging) movement in the [Pangasinan version](https://www.kaloobdance.com/Wasiwas.html) of the dance _[pandanggo sa ilaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu8XqO0knYg)_, where candles cradled in porous cloth are swung in a manner reminiscent of village folk vigorously waving lights along the beach to guide fishermen on their way back home to celebrate a good catch.
